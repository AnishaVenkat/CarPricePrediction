# CarPricePrediction
In this project I have built an end to end application which predicts the selling price of old car based on various features

Libraries Used:

matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
Pandas
numpy

Based on the features the CarName , Selling Price, Present Price, Kms_Driven,Fuel Type,Seller Type,Transmission and no of previous owners the price of the car is predicted.

Firstly various data preprocessing methods have been applied to dataset for better understanding of the features and feature importance techniques is also applied to retain the Importance features alone.

For model building i have applied trial and error methods where ensemble methods like GradientBoosting and RandomForest have given better accuracy than other models.

For furthermore Optimization of models i have used Hyperparameter Tuning which reduced overfitting of models as well.

Below are the results of R2 score for various models:
Linear Regression:86%
Ridge :85%
Lasso:85%
GradientBoosting:94%
RandomForest:91%

App buidling : Basic HTML and css is applied for the Front end.

For the backend i have used Flask and Postman for testing end to end application.
